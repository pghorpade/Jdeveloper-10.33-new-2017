/**
 * A sample single-threaded servlet that takes input from a form
 * and writes it out to a file.  It is single threaded to serialize
 * access to the file.  After the results are written to the file,
 * the servlet returns a "thank you" to the user.
 * <p/>
 * <p>You can run the servlet as provided, and only one thread will run
 * a service method at a time.  There are no thread synchronization
 * issues with this type of servlet, even though the service method
 * writes to a file.  (Writing to a file within a service method
 * requires synchronization in a typical servlet.)
 * <p/>
 * <p>You can also run the servlet without using the single thread
 * model by removing the <tt>implements</tt> statement.  Because the
 * service method does not synchronize access to the file, multiple
 * threads can write to it at the same time.  When multiple threads try
 * to write to the file concurrently, the data from one survey does not
 * follow the data from another survey in an orderly fashion.
 * <p/>
 * <p>To see interaction (or lack of interaction) between threads, use
 * at least two browser windows and have them access the servlet as
 * close to simultaneously as possible.  Expect correct results (that
 * is, expect no interference between threads) only when the servlet
 * implements the <code>SingleThreadedModel</code> interface.
