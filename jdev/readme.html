<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Oracle JDeveloper 10g is a complete and integrated development environment 
  for standards-based SOA applications. The Oracle JDeveloper 10g Release 3 (10.1.3) 
  version adds many new features including a new look and feel, a greatly improved 
  coding environment with extensive refactoring options, support for the latest 
  Java standards (J2SE 5.0, J2EE 1.4, EJB 3.0), and visual JSF development. A 
  visual and declarative approach and the improved Oracle Application Development 
  Framework (Oracle ADF) work together to simplify application development and 
  reduce mundane coding tasks, offering developers unparalleled productivity regardless 
  of their choice of technology stacks and deployment platforms.</p>
<p>Oracle JDeveloper (10.1.3.1.0) extends the IDE features from the previous release 
  by adding integrated SOA development tools to provide an Integrated Service 
  Environment workbench. In particular, BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) 
  and ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) tooling is now fully integrated into JDeveloper. 
  In addition, JDeveloper's core IDE features for EJB 3 and JPA (Java Persistence 
  API) have been extended, and made fully up to date with the final EJB 3 specification.</p>
<p>Oracle JDeveloper 10.1.3.2.0 completes the picture by further extending the 
  IDE with the WebCenter Extension for JDeveloper. The WebCenter Framework capabilities 
  and resources are seamlessly integrated and exposed in JDeveloper; for example, 
  WebCenter components are readily accessible from a catalog of resources available 
  on the Components and Data Control palettes. Additionally, the WebCenter extension 
  provides several wizards to help you with essential development tasks such as 
  building a portlet, consuming an existing portlet, creating a data control to 
  a content repository, and securing your application. </p>

<p>Please review the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/htdocs/10.1.3.2/index.html">Oracle 
  JDeveloper Release Notes Addendum</a> for additional information not available 
  at the time of this document's publication. For more information and technical 
  resources for JDeveloper, visit the JDeveloper product center on the Oracle 
  Technology Network. (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/101">http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/101</a>)</p>
<h2><a name="ide"></a>General IDE Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="ide1"></a>Incompatibility between internal CVS client and CVSNT server 
  (5362113)</h3>
<p>In some cases binary files can become corrupted when using JDeveloper's internal 
  CVS client against a CVSNT server. The workaround is to use CVSNT's client within 
  JDeveloper. This can be configured on the Versioning |CVS panel of IDE preferences.</p>
<h2><a name="dep"></a>Deployment Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="dep1"></a>EJB web service fails to deploy to JDeveloper's embedded 
  server (5132396)</h3>
<p>JDeveloper may exceed the length of the path names permitted by Windows when 
  you compile an EJB session bean with a web service annotation. The path name 
  JDeveloper generates for the web service class file is concatenated from three 
  elements: the path to the application-deployment folders (set by system and 
  not editable), the path to the web service source folder (also set by system), 
  and the path to the class file specified by its package name (set by user and 
  must be as short as possible).</p>
<p>For example, the following path would be created for a web service class file, 
  where the user-specified portion of the path name is based on the package name 
  <code>com.oracle.myapp.ejb.webservice.test</code>. </p>
  <p><code>&lt;JDev_Install&gt;jdev\system\oracle.j2ee.10.1.3.37.58\embedded-oc4j\application-deployments\\current-workspace-app\MyApplication_MyProject\ws-src\com\oracle\myapp\ejb\webservice\test</code></p>
<p>and results in the exception:</p>
<code>
oracle.j2ee.ws.common.tools.api.SeiValidationException: Interface 
&lt;classname&gt;.SessionEJBBeanPortType: The class could not be loaded from 
the class path.</code>
<p>You can workaround this limitation by shortening the name of the package you 
  enter when you create the EJB session bean. For example, instead of <code>com.oracle.myapp.ejb.webservice.test</code>, 
  as shown in the above example, the package name <code>com.oracle.myapp</code> 
  will result in a legal class path length.</p>
<h3><a name="dep2"></a>ADF web application with EJB3 model project dependency 
  fails to deploy (5237303)</h3>
  
<p> When you deploy an ADF web application WAR file to Standalone OC4J you may 
  encounter the following error due to multiple persistence unit definitions resulting 
  from an EJB3 model project dependency:</p>
  
<code> DeployerRunnable.run[application1:ejb3_mdnav_adffaces] - Multiple persistence 
units with name "model" are defined at the same scope.oracle.oc4j.admin.internal.DeployerException: 
[application1:ejb3_mdnav_adffaces] - Multiple persistence units with name "model" 
are defined at the same scope.</code> 
<p>To avoid this error, update the ViewController project settings to remove the 
  dependency on the Model project before deploying the ADF web application to 
  Standlone OC4J.</p>
<h3><a name="dep3"></a>Deploying JDeveloper deployment profiles to archive files 
  on the file system </h3>
  
<p>When deploying JDeveloper deployment profiles to an archive file the default 
  behavior is to deploy the archive as standard J2EE. In order to deploy an archive 
  to a file for a specific application server platform to incorporate platform 
  specific descriptor handling, the user must set the Target Connection in the 
  Deployment Profiles - Platform page. The Target Connection can only be set to 
  something other than the default (J2EE) after creating an application server 
  connection in the connection navigator.</p>
<h2><a name="db"></a>Database Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="db1"></a>Entity created only for first table in entity beans from 
  tables in Oracle Lite (5251201)</h3>
<p>Oracle Lite version 10.2.0.2 does not support standard JDBC metadata for column 
  definitions, resulting in an inability to create EJB entities. We expect this 
  to be fixed in Oracle Lite 10.2.0.3.</p>
<h2><a name="mod"></a>Modeling Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="mod1"></a>Refactoring context menu and UML (4463153)</h3>
<p>From the App Navigator context menu the refactoring submenu is visible for 
  navigator packages containing UML artifacts. However, refactoring the package 
  will NOT cause UML artifact to be refactored, though Java and other types will 
  be refactored as expected.</p>
<h3><a name="mod2"></a>Java modeler accessibility (4541424)</h3>
<p>The Java Modeler's popup code editor is not currently accessible when using 
  JAWS screen reader. The workaround is to invoke 'Go To Source' instead of 'Edit' 
  for Java elements on the diagram, which will invoke the main code editor.</p>
<h2><a name="tl"></a>Toplink Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="tl1"></a>Importing tables with multibyte characters (5254287)</h3>
<p>When importing database tables named with multibyte characters, you must change 
  the JDeveloper encoding to UTF-8.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select Tools > Preferences > Environment.</li>
  <li>Change Encoding to UTF-8.</li>
  <li>Restart JDeveloper, then import the tables.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="ejb"></a>EJB Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="ejb1"></a>EJB 3.0 application migration issue (10.1.3 -&gt; 10.1.3.1)</h3>
<p>In 10.1.3.1 the lifespan of an entity's Persistence Context is strictly tied 
  to the lifespan of its associated transaction, since by default, a PersistenceContext's 
  type is PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION. </p>
<p>This requirement was relaxed in 10.1.3, and some applications were found to 
  be dependent on this requirement not being met.</p>
<p>To operate under the stricter requirement in 10.1.3.1, EJB 3.0 Stateless Session 
  beans migrated from JDev 10.1.3 and interacting with web clients may need to 
  be changed to Stateful Session beans. </p>
<p>In addition to this change, the generated:</p>
<pre>

@Resource
EntityManager em;
</pre>
<p>statement should be changed to:</p>
<pre>

@PersistenceContext(type=PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED)
EntityManager em;
</pre>
<p>to allow web clients to perform additional operations on entities returned from the (newly Stateful) Session bean.</p>
<h3><a name="ejb2" id="ejb2"></a>Running EJB 3.0 applications (5524015)</h3>
<p>EJB 3.0 runtime is different between JDeveloper release 10.1.3 and JDeveloper 
  release 10.1.3.1. An EJB 3.0 application created in JDeveloper 10.1.3 will only 
  work with AS 10.1.3, and an EJB 3.0 application created in JDeveloper 10.1.3.1 
  will only work with SOA 10.1.3.1. </p>
<p>You can migrate EJB 3.0 applications from JDeveloper 10.1.3 to JDeveloper 10.1.3.1 
  following the instructions in the online help topic Getting Started with Oracle 
  JDeveloper &gt; Migrating to Oracle JDeveloper 10g &gt; Migrating EJB 3.0 Applications 
  from Oracle JDeveloper 10g Release 10.1.3 to 10.1.3.1.</p>

<h2><a name="ws"></a>Web Services Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="ws1" id="ws1"></a>Top-down SOAP 1.2 services changed to SOAP 1.1 
  after editing (5499466)</h3>
<p>If you create a web service top-down from a WSDL that contains SOAP 1.2 bindings, 
  then modify that service in the web service editor, the bindings are changed 
  to SOAP 1.1.</p>
<p>The workaround is in the Web Services Editor dialog, manually deselect SOAP 
  1.1 Binding and select SOAP 1.2 Binding instead.</p>
<h3><a name="ws2" id="ws2"></a>Top-down service with one-way operations changed 
  to two-way methods after editing (5499473)</h3>
<p>If you create a top-down web service that has one-way operations, then use 
  the Web Service Editor to change the service or invoke Regenerate Web Service 
  from Source, the one-way operations are changed to two-way operations. </p>
<p>The workaround is in the Web Services Editor dialog, manually check the Create 
  One-Way Operations From Void Methods checkbox.</p>
  
<h3><a name="ws3" id="ws3"></a>Top-down web services generated with enumerated 
  types fail validation (4740097)</h3>
<p>When you generate a top-down web service a WSDL with enumerated types, subsequent 
  changes made to the service in the Web Service Editor cannot be committed due 
  to an error in validation.</p>
<h3> <a name="ws4" id="ws4"></a>Deleting Init Param or Header in a web service 
  handler causes an error (4696318)</h3>
<p>If you have created a web service handler that uses an Init Param and/or a 
  Header, and you subsequently edit the handler to remove the Init Param or the 
  Header, JDeveloper displays an error message.</p>
<p> The workaround is to remove the handler, then recreate it without the initial 
  parameter.</p>
<h3><a name="ws5" id="ws5"></a>Web service proxy fails when running with reliability 
  settings (4644877)</h3>
<p>When you run a proxy to a web service that has reliability enabled you may 
  find that it fails, and on examination with the HTTP Analyzer the SOAP message 
  returned from the server has an empty body. This can occur because the default 
  value of Expiry Time on the Operation Settings tab of the proxy reliability 
  wizard is 1 second.</p>
<p>The workaround is to increase the expiry time to 2 seconds or more.</p>
  
<h3><a name="ws6" id="ws6"></a>'Invoke' button not present in EM for testing EJB3.0 
  web service on external OC4J (4769395)</h3>
<p>If you deploy an EJB3.0 web service to external OC4J, and try to test it from
  Oracle Enterprise Manager, the Invoke button is not always present. There is
  no workaround.</p>
<h3> <a name="ws7" id="ws7"></a>Invalid web service endpoint in generated proxy 
  for multi-port WSDLs (4867854)</h3>
<p>When you create a proxy to a web service with more than one port, the proxy
  may be generated with an invalid endpoint for the web service.</p>
<p> The workaround is to examine the WSDL to find the correct endpoint URL, and
  paste this into the generated proxy class.</p>
<h3><a name="ws8" id="ws8"></a>Runtime exception when more than one web service 
  exists in a project (4861145)</h3>
<p>If you create two or more web services in a project that use the same mapping
  file, you will get a runtime exception.<br>
  The workaround is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> For bottom-up web service generation, specify a serviceName argument value 
    that does not already exist for the second web service.</li>
  <li>For top-down web service generation, make sure the web services are each 
    in a different WAR for deployment so that the same deployment descriptor is 
    not used.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ws9" id="ws8"></a>Using the 'class' attribute in Ant build scripts 
  to specify JAX-RPC web service handlers (5646640)</h3>
<p>If you edit a build.xml file that defines web service handlers in an Ant task, 
  the handler code allows you to specify the handler class name using either the 
  'class' or 'handlerClass' attributes. However, if you use handlerClass to specify 
  the class name in JDeveloper, the editor will display a red line under handlerClass 
  and incorrectly indicate that it is not defined on the handler element. This 
  occurs because XML schema that is registered with JDeveloper does not recognize 
  the handlerClass attribute.</p>
<p>To avoid this error, use the class attribute to specify the handler class name. 
</p>
<h3><a name="ws10" id="ws8"></a>Intermittent failure when using WS-I testing tools</h3>
  
<p>You may find that the WS-I testing tool fails to run from time to time. When 
  JDeveloper exits abnormally, the default work directory (where <code>/mywork </code>
  folder is created) may be stored incorrectly. When you next run the WS-I testing 
  tools, JDeveloper attempts to write the WS-I tester's launch script to the default 
  work directory, and if this directory does not exist WS-I testing tools fail.</p>
<p>The workaround is to to try one or both of the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Recreate the missing directory.</li>
  <li>Delete the <i>&lt;jdev_install&gt;</i>/jdev/system/oracle.jdeveloper.<i>nnnnn</i>/system.sys 
    configuration file, which records the location of the work directory.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ws11" id="ws8"></a>Cannot delete last node in design view of the 
  WSDL editor (5516003)</h3>
<p>In the design view of the WSDL editor you cannot delete the last node in any 
  of the four columns. Instead, you must delete the node from the Structure window, 
  or from the code view of the WSDL editor.</p>
<h2><a name="jsf"></a>JavaServer Faces (JSF) Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="jsf1"></a>In JSF 1.1_02 pages under /WEB-INF fail to load</h3>
<p>JDeveloper 10.1.3.1 upgrades to the JavaServer Faces reference implementation 
  version 1.1_02. This maintenance release of the JSF runtime from Sun introduces 
  a new restriction preventing the processing of any JSF page located in the ./WEB-INF 
  directory (or subdirectory thereof). If your JSF applications contain pages 
  in the WEB-INF directory, you will need to move those pages to another directory 
  under the web root other than WEB-INF for them to function correctly. If your 
  JSF pages use ADF Model data binding, after moving the JSP/JSPX pages from ./WEB-INF 
  (or subdirectory) to a new directory under your web root, you will need to reflect 
  the change in the &quot;path&quot; value inside the &lt;pageMap&gt; section 
  of your DataBindings.cpx file. For example, if your page previously had a &quot;path&quot; 
  value of &quot;/WEB-INF/page/Test.jspx&quot; and you moved this Test.jspx page 
  to ./public_html/page/Test.jspx -- where ./public_html is the HTML root directory 
  of your view controller project -- then you must edit the value of the path 
  and change it from &quot;/WEB-INF/page/Test.jspx&quot; to &quot;/page/Test.jspx&quot;.</p>
<h2><a name="sec"></a>Security Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="sec1"></a>Configuring ADF security to use a file-based repository</h3>
<p>OC4J works exclusively with the user repository defined in the system-jazn-data.xml 
  file for Embedded OC4J. If you select Application Repository in the ADF Security 
  wizard, you must migrate user, role, and policy information from the wizard-generated 
  jazn-data.xml file to either the system-jazn-data.xml file or, in the case of 
  a production application, to Oracle Internet Directory (OID). For details, see 
  the release note topic &quot;Using JAZNMigrationTool with JDeveloper.
</p>
<h3><a name="sec2"></a>Using JAZNMigrationTool with JDeveloper</h3>
<p>The JAZNMigrationTool provides a way to migrate the contents of one store to 
  another that can then be loaded to the LDAP directory. The command to be used 
  is:</p>
<pre><code>

java JAZNMigrationTool -D binddn -w passwd [-h ldaphost] [-p ldapport]
				[-sf filename] [-df LDIF_filename]
				[-sr source_realm] [-dr dest_realm]
				[-m policy|realm|all] 
				[-help]</code>
								
</pre>
								  
  
<p>Below is an example of migrating all users, roles, and JAAS policies from embedded-oc4j\config\system-jazn-data.xml 
  to j2ee\home\config\system-jazn-data.xml</p>
<pre><code>

set CLASSPATH=JDEV_HOME\j2ee\home\jazn.jar;%CLASSPATH%</code></pre>
<pre><code>

JDEV_HOME\jdk\bin\Java oracle.security.jazn.tools.JAZNMigrationTool -w welcome 
-sf JDEV_HOME\jdev\system\oracle.j2ee.<i>xxxx</i>\embedded-oc4j\config\system-jazn-data.xml 
-df JDEV_HOME\j2ee\home\config\system-jazn-data.xml -dt xml 
</code></pre>
<p>Note that JDEV_HOME should be the directory where they install JDeveloper. 
  XXXX represents the final build number.</p>
<p>For more information see Java JAZNMigrationTool -help.</p>
<h3><a name="sec3"></a>Enable JAAS mode when using ADF with LDAP identity management</h3>
<p>When using ADF with LDAP-based identity management, make sure to enable JAAS 
  mode. Please refer to Oracle Containers for J2EE Security Guide for details 
  on how to enable JAAS mode.</p>
<p>JAAS mode can be enabled by adding the following line in orion-application.xml: 
</p>
<pre>

&lt;orion-application ... &gt;
	...
	&lt;jazn provider=&quot;XML&quot; jaas-mode=&quot;doAsPrivileged&quot; /&gt;
	...
&lt;/orion-application&gt; 
</pre>
<h2><a name="misc"></a>Miscellaneous Issues </h2>
<h3><a name="misca"></a>SOA Suite documentation</h3>
  
<p>Please refer to the Oracle Application Server documentation library for the 
  most up-to-date documentation available for BPEL Process Manager and Enterprise 
  Service Bus.</p>
<h3><a name="misc2"></a>Running ADF installer against Application Server 10.1.2 
  instance (4897250)</h3>
<p>When running the ADF installer within JDeveloper (Tools--&gt; ADF Installer) 
  against an Application Server 10.1.2 instance, the user may encounter the error 
  &quot;Cannot finish the installation&quot; even if the server is shut down. 
  In addition to stopping the Application Server instance, the user must also 
  shut down the Application Server Control Manager(EM) service before running 
  the ADF Installer against the Application Server 10.1.2 instance. </p>
<h3><a name="miscbc4j"></a>Restore option does not restore bc4j.ear</h3>
<p>Use of the restore facility does not redeploy bc4j.ear to the 10.1.3.0.0 application 
  server. This should not affect functionality, as datatags.ear is exactly the 
  same as bc4j.ear. However, if required bc4j.ear must be manually deployed using 
  the EM console.</p>
<p>The &lt;JDev_Install&gt;/BC4J/redist/ folder contains the renamed datatags.ear 
  file. In previous releases this file was the bc4j.ear file. The new name more 
  accurately reflects the contents of this file and it's limited role to provide 
  web application images and CSS support for the deprecated BC4J JSP Datatag library.</p>
