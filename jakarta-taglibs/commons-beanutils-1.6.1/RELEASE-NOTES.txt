                          Commons BeanUtils Package
                                Version 1.6.1
                               Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:
============

Beanutils 1.6.1 is a bug fix release. 
The 1.6 release notes can be found at the bottom of this document.

CHANGES:
========

The ConstructorUtils java docs have been improved.

ConvertingWrapDynaBean
----------------------

Use BeanUtils.copyProperty() instead of BeanUtils.setProperty() so that
Object->Object conversions -- via registered Converters, if any, are done.

BeanUtils
---------

Enhance BeanUtils.copyProperty() to deal with about 80% of the use cases for
copying indexed, mapped, and nested properties with type conversions.  The
remaining restrictions are documented in the Javadocs for this method.

This is a partial response to Bugzilla #16525, which documents some
restrictions in the functionality of copyProperty() that leads people
to try setProperty() instead -- which they should not do.

It is much more conservative than the proposed patch, which (as the reporter
acknowledges) is more appropriate in a minor update (1.7) versus a bugfix
patch (1.6.1) which is currently contemplated.

BUG REPORTS ADDRESSED:
=====================

16854 ResultSetDynaClass misspelled ResutSetDynaClass
16525 (partial) BeanUtils.setProperty is over-zealous at converting types






                          Commons BeanUtils Package
                                Version 1.6
                               Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:
============

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
BeanUtils package, and highlights changes since the previous version.


NEW FEATURES:
============

New Classes
-----------

Initial checkin of a new class providing reflection utilities for constructors
(similar to MethodUtils). See org.apache.commons.beanutils.ConstructorUtils.

Added a new DynaClass implementation that creates an in-memory collection of 
DyanBeans representing the results of a SQL query. 
See org.apache.commons.beanutils.RowSetDynaClass.java


DyanBeans Enhancements
----------------------

Improved DynaProperty serialization on Java 1.3 by adding a custom 
serialization mechanism. Now primitive type classes will be correctly serialized 
on Java 1.3.

ResultSetDynaClass: Made it possible to select an operational mode where column 
names are *not* lower cased when being converted into DynaBean property names.  
Because different JDBC drivers behave differently with regards to the case of 
the column names they return, using this mode will make your application
dependent upon the behavior of your particular JDBC driver.  However, there
are some circumstances when consciously selecting such dependence is
necessary.

Cleaned up Javadoc generation warnings under JDK 1.4.

BeanComparator Enhancements
---------------------------

Added getComparator() property allowing retrieval of Comparator being used.

Cleaned up Javadoc generation warnings under JDK 1.4.

BeanUtils Enhancements
----------------------

Enhanced the behavior of BeanUtils.setProperty() such that, if the destination
property is a String and there is a registered Converter for the value's
class, the value's toString() method will be called, followed by conversion
to the appropriate destination type.  Among other things, this makes it
possible to pass in a primitive wrapper type (such as Integer) and have it
converted to a String.

Performance improvements.

Java doc comments improvements.

MethodUtils Enhancements
------------------------

Made getMatchingAccessibleMethod public. 

Converters Enhancements
-----------------------

Added support for Number types in numeric converter classes.

LocaleConvertUtils Enhancements
-------------------------------

Cleaned up Javadoc generation warnings under JDK 1.4.  

DateLocaleConverter Enhancements
--------------------------------

Added new Lenient property that allows lenient to be get and set on the 
underlying date formatter.

DEPRECATED
==========

org.apache.common.beanutils.BeanUtils getDebug(), setDebug() 
    (replaced by commons-logging)
    
org.apache.common.beanutils.PropertyUtils getDebug(), setDebug() 
    (replaced by commons-logging)
